There are a thousand ways to make Marinara Sauce. My Mom used Del Monte Tomato Sauce and Paste. I had Aunts that made it with just paste. People use Tomato Sauce, Crushed Tomatoes, Diced Tomatoes and some, not in our family actually used Ketchup with water! I had Aunt’s that added sugar. Some people use as a seasoning fresh or dried Basil, Oregano, Parsley, Thyme and Rosemary. While others add onion, garlic, celery, carrots or peppers. As you can see a thousand combinations are easily possible.

When it comes to tomato brands people swear by Pompadour San Marzano Tomatoes grown in Campania under Mt Vesuvius, others are grown in Sicily. The only problem with that is, authentic Pompadour tomatoes are only grown in certain areas of Italy. The others are grown all over the world yet people pay a premium thinking they are getting the originals. High end restaurants charge customers a fortune for Pompadour tomatoes and spinning a fork full of Spaghetti on a plate, drizzling sauce around the plate with some shavings of Parmesan Cheese, topped with a sprinkle of fresh basil for only $24.00. You can feed a small army Spaghetti for that price.

In the early 1970’s I used 28 ounce cans of Tuttorosso Whole Tomatoes with Basil crushing them with my hand. Then I switch to crushed tomatoes of the same brand. When Shoprite had them on sale I would buy 4 – 12 can cases. In the 1990’s I was at Costco and saw 106 ounce cans of S&W Premium Crushed Tomatoes and tried them and no one could tell the difference.  

I want to give you a recipe that I have been using for 50 years with the ingredients I use today. The concept is trying the recipe the way I give it to you a few times. Then keep it or experiment with different tomatoes, vegetables, herbs and spices and develop your very own style. But the whole process should be fun and always get the kids involved too.

Always read the Ingredients and Instructions **TWICE!**
{: .notice--success }

**PREPARATION**: 15 minutes<br>
**COOK TIME**: 30 minutes<br>
**SERVINGS**: will accompany 3lbs of pasta<br>
**EPISODE**: 005


### Ingredients

* **1 large red onion** (the onions I use are about 14 to 16 ounces)
* **1 blub/bag of garlic** (you can use 2 or 3 cloves but try the bulb or bag)
* **1/4 cup olive oil** (you can use any oil, I use olive oil)
* **1 106 oz. can of S&amp;W Crushed Tomatoes**
* **1 tbsp dried basil**
* **1 tbsp dried oregano**
* **1/3 cup fresh parsley, chopped**

### Preparation

1. Chop the red onion. Smash the garlic with the flat part of a chef’s knife and chop.
2. Place a 6 or 8 quart pan on medium high heat with the oil.
3. After a few minutes drop a piece of onion in the oil, if it sizzles add onion and garlic. If it does not sizzle wait a minute and drop another onion until it does.
4. Cook the onion and garlic on medium high heat until browned. Stirring every couple of minutes. If they start to burn lower your heat. You will get comfortable with the process.
5. After about 10 minutes they will be sizzling and brown, now add the crushed tomatoes. Keep the heat on medium high and watch and stir until the sauce starts to bubble (not boil). Then lower the heat to simmer. This should take about another 10 minutes.
6. Add your basil and oregano by placing them in the palm of your hand and rubbing your hands together over the sauce to intensify their flavors, add the fresh parsley and stir.
7. Let it simmer another 5 minutes and your Marinara Sauce is ready for Prime Time.

## Options & Extras

The smell of your kitchen and house will make your family and guest feel like they are in the best Italian restaurant. Let the kids help by opening the can of sauce, plucking the parsley leaves from the stems, by measuring out the basil and oregano in a dish, and by stirring the sauce.

I also on occasion, when the onions and garlic are brown, add a 1/2 cup of red wine (Pinot Noir) to deglaze the pan. Let it reduce until the wine is almost gone then add the sauce.

Always cook more than you need because it freezes well. We pour leftover sauce in quart or gallon freezer bags, lay them flat on a cookie sheet and freeze. Then you can stack on top of one another or stand up in the freezer next to each other.

The whole point of cooking is to have fun! Involve your children, family and friends. That is how you learn and develop you own style and taste.

## A Note from Little Vinny

I've cooked this recipe for as long as I can remember with my parents. From big family gathering to having it cooking while we watched the Giants on TV on Sundays. It was the easiest most cost effective way to eat good when I got out on my own. And it was an easy way to impress with my cooking skills. It is also a great base for making other favorites: meatballs, hot italian sausage, and braciole. I am sure Dad (Pop) will get to these recipes as well. Enjoy the food, and as my Grandfather used to say, "Mangia, mangia!".
