Eggplant Parmigiana has always been an Italian Classic and a meatless Friday meal for decades. It takes some time to make but the more you make it the easier it becomes especially with help from Dad or the children. It is also great made a day or two in advance for family or friends and it is great as a leftover. It is also delicious cold right out of the refrigerator either plain or in a hard roll or crusty piece of Italian bread or a nice crusty piece of real Rye Bread with seeds. Also when you make it yourself, at home, you will get a chance to taste something very special, fried eggplant plain or a fried eggplant sandwich still warm from being fried. When you watch the video you will see us stealing pieces of fried eggplant and eating our favorite a fried eggplant sandwich! It is so good we hope you try it yourselves.

**EPISODE**: 009

### Ingredients

* **2 Eggplants 1lb** or larger
* **3 to 4 eggs** beaten together
* *1/2 to 3/4 cup corn oil* or any other high heat oil – Sunflower, Safflower or Canola 1 - 15 ounce can of Progresso Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs
* **1/2 cup dried parsley**
* **1/4 cup granulated garlic**
* **16 ounces whole milk mozzarella**
* **1/2 cup Pecorino Romano** or Parmesan cheese

* **1 recipe of Marinara Sauce** (see [Marinara video for easy 30 minute recipe](/recipes/007_Marinara_Sauce/))

### Preparation: Fried Eggplant

1. Peel and cut eggplant into rounds at about 1/8 to 1/4 inch in thickness
2. Using an aluminum tray or deep dish, plate bread crumbs, dried parsley and granulated garlic in tray
    (It might sound like too much garlic but try it)
3. Mix dry ingredients to combine
4. Place a cooling rack to the left of your frying pan on the stove with aluminum foil under screen. This is where you will put the fried finished eggplant after frying to a golden brown.
5. Depending on how your cooking area is set up place the seasoned bread crumbs closest to the fry pan with the beaten egg next then peeled cut eggplant.
6. Place oil in frying pan on medium to medium high heat, oil should be about 1/4 inch high in pan
7. Dip the eggplant rounds into the egg, then put into bread crumbs and press crumbs into eggplant to make sure the eggplant is coated with crumbs and place into the hot oil. Use a test piece to ensure the oil is hot enough to get a rich brown color. 
8. Now continue to cook and brown eggplant and place on cooling rack
9. Sometimes you might need to add more oil between fry batches.
10.  When all the eggplant is cooked either eat some of the fried eggplant plain or make a sandwich with just the fried eggplant.

### Preparation: Casserole

1. Cut mozzarella with a wire cheese cutter or knife. Cut it thin and the pieces do not have to be round
2. Cover the bottom of the 9” X 13” casserole with Marinara Sauce
3. Place a layer of eggplant to cover the bottom of the casserole
4. put a piece of mozzarella on each piece of eggplant
5. Put a light coating of Marinara Sauce over first layer of eggplant
6. Place another layer of fried eggplant on first layer, add mozzarella and Marinara Sauce
7. Use whatever is left to make a third layer or make that fried eggplant sandwich we mentioned in the beginning and enjoy
8. on the last layer sprinkle with Pecorino Romano or Parmesan Cheese 


**Note:** When Grandma Jane is finished frying the eggplant she dumps the remaining bread crumbs into the oil to absorb the oil before discarding.

Cook in a 350 degree F or 176 degrees C for about 30 to 40 minutes. You can tell it is done because the sides of the casserole should be bubbling. Let rest for at least 15 minutes before serving. We even let it rest for an hour while cooking other items.

## Extras

Eggplant is delicious served a day or two later. After combining casserole place plastic wrap over casserole and then aluminum foil. Place in the refrigerator. Take out a day or two later and let it sit out for about 1/2 hour then bake as above.

Eggplant Parmigiana is great leftover cold or hot in a sandwich. Our families have even eaten it for breakfast cold. Please watch the video before attempting this recipe and watch Grandma Jane do her thing. This will help to make sense of the entre process. Enjoy!
