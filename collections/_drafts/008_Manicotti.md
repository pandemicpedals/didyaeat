I met Jane in September of 1965. I enjoyed going to Jane’s house to help/watch Jane’s Mom, Antoinette,
make homemade Manicotti, Raviolis and different flavored Fettuccini. They are not that difficult to
make but maybe that is because we have been making them for decades. Don’t fear, because the recipe
is straight forward, does not take that long to prepare and the family can help! We will get the other
pasta recipes on the DidyaEatNY website as soon as possible.

In 2015 we made 420 manicotti for our local church in Arizona with just 2 inexperienced helpers. They
have a 4 foot grill and Jane was able to make 10 manicotti shells at a time. One helper made a double
batter recipe to keep Jane supplied with batter. Another helper took the cooked shells and lined them
on covered tables to be filled and I made the Manicotti filling and cut the mozzarella sticks. 

When all the
shells were made and lined up on 8 - 6 foot tables Jane filled each shell and rolled them and we filled
sauced hotel pans with the finished manicotti. We sauced the top of the pans with Marinara sauce,
Pecorino Romano Cheese and fresh chopped parsley. We covered the 14 trays and put them in the
cooler. We also made 200 meatballs and 200 Italian sausages. 

Father only charges $3.00 per person
because he is not trying to make money but saying thank you to the parishioners. Some of the patrons
asked if we do this once a month and we laughed and said NO! I was 70 then and Jane was 68 and we
were pooped! We have also made them for the soup kitchen in Middletown NY and for all occasions. It
is a great meal that can be prepared ahead of time and you can just pop them in the oven the next day
to heat.

## Recipe

Always read the ingredients and preparation **TWICE** before you start!
{: .notice--success }

This is a double recipe because they are great leftover for the next few days or frozen to be reheated
weeks later.

**PREPARATION**: 1 hour &amp; 30 minutes (but takes less time with family/friends help)<br>
**COOK TIME**: 40 minutes<br>
**SERVINGS**: Makes about 36 manicotti’s which will feed 18 people or 12 hungry people

**Little Vinny:** Or 6 teen aged boys, since they can eat 2 hungry servings.
{: .notice--success }

### Manicotti Shells Ingredients:

* **8 extra large eggs** (if you only have large that will be fine)
* **2 cups of water**
* **2 cups of flour**

### Preparation: Shells

1. In a large mixing bowl whisk eggs, add water and whisk then add flour a little at a time and mix
well to combine
2. Place two wax paper sheets about 3 feet long, overlapping one another next to the griddle
3. Heat a skillet to 350&deg; F. When it reaches temp spray lightly with canola oil
4. With a small ladle, pour about 3 ounces of batter on the griddle. With the bottom of the ladle
placed in the center of the batter puddle make small circular motions to spread the batter to
create about a 5 to 6 inch wide crepe. Our griddle makes 3 crepes at a time.
5. By the time you finish spreading the third crepe the others will start to produce small bubbles
and become dry. Try not to make them too thick; you might have to make them a few times to
make them correctly. But thick or thin they are delicious.
6. Flip all three quickly and remove within 5 seconds and place on the wax paper. The underside
cooks quickly.
7. Spray some canola oil on a paper towel and if the crepes start to stick wipe the griddle with the
towel
8. Stir the batter every so often and you can add a little water to the batter to achieve 18 crepes
While you are making the crepes have someone else make the filling which is easy

**Little Vinny Tip:** If you do not have a griddle you can do this in a non-stick pan as well. I typically 
use a 10 inch pan and do one at a time using the same procedure. It will take a little longer doing them 
one at a time but they are just as good.

### Manicotti Filling Ingredients:

* **2 pounds of Whole Milk Ricotta Cheese** (when I open the container I place a folded paper towel on top
to soak up some of the water)
* **1 pound of Whole Milk Mozzarella** (cut into 36 strips)
* **1 1/2 cups of grated Pecorino Romano Cheese** (you can use Parmesan)
* **2 extra large eggs** (large is fine)
* **1 cup of finely chopped fresh Parsley** (do not use dried parsley, unless that is all you have)

### Preparation: Filing

1. Place the Ricotta and eggs into a mixing bowl and combine with a spoon
2. Add the Pecorino Romano and mix
3. Add the parsley and mix to combine

**Note:** watching the video a few times before preparation will help to make sense of the process. This is a good
time to preheat the oven to 350&deg; F
{: .notice--info }

### Preparation: Combining Shells and Filing to make the Manicotti

1. You have the Manicotti shells on wax paper already.
2. Place a heaping teaspoon of filling in each one.
3. After filling all 36 manicotti divide the remaining filling throughout the 36 to evenly fill each,
accuracy is not important
4. Place a mozzarella stick that you cut behind the filling
5. Pull the front of the shell over the filling behind the mozzarella stick and pull the mozzarella stick
toward you and like a squeeze it will fill the shell
6. Roll the filled shell with the flap on the bottom and place in the sauces pan flap down.
7. Top the tray with Marinara Sauce, sprinkle with Pecorino Romano Cheese and some fresh
chopped parsley.
8. You can get 18 manicotti into a 8 X 13 Pyrex glass baking dish or in aluminum pans
9. Cover with Stretch-tite first then Aluminum Foil

Cook immediately, refrigerate for the next day or two or freeze for next week.

Cook at 350&deg; F for 40 minutes. When you check to see if they are done there should be bubbling on the
edges of the tray/pan.

## Extras

If you **refrigerate** in Pyrex let sit out for an hour before placing in the oven. If you use aluminum pans
they can be put directly in the oven cold.

If you **freeze** in Pyrex place in refrigerator overnight, then cook as above. If in Aluminum trays they can
go directly in the oven, and then put oven on for 350&deg; F.

After you have your meal and there is Manicotti left over (which was our plan for a double recipe) place
4 in a freezer bag and freeze on a cooking tray then you can place frozen Manicotti on top of one
another. When you are ready to reheat defrost in microwave until not frozen, place in a dish and
microwave until hot. They will taste as good as when first made. 

If you’re making a single recipe for you
and your partner you will have 18 Manicotti. Only sauce and cook as many as you can eat, including
leftover if you wish, then place the plain rolled Manicotti on a cookie sheet, in a single layer and freeze.
Then place in a freezer bag. When you want Manicotti again take out as many frozen as you want,
sauce, add Pecorino Romano and fresh parsley and cook.
