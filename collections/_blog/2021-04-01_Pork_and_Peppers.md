This is a recipe that has only two main ingredients, is easy to make, unique and delicious. It is a recipe we started using from Jane’s Mom’s pork chop recipe and her cousin Jim’s wife Dina’s recipe for Chicken Pepperoncini.

## Recipe

Always read the ingredients and preparation instruction TWICE before starting!
{: .notice--info }

**PREPARATION**: 10 minutes<br>
**COOK TIME**: 1 hour and 50 minutes (20 minutes to brown Pork 1 hour & 30 minutes simmering)<br>
**SERVINGS**: 3 servings for every 1 1/2 lbs of pork

### Ingredients

* **1 1/2 lbs of boneless pork butt** (cut into 1 1/2 inch thick, 5 inch strips)
* **1 16oz jar of Sweet Cherry Peppers** (we use Mezzetta sweet Cherry Peppers but you can use hot)
* **Salt and pepper to taste** – but salt not needed at all because of pepper juice
* **Oil for browning pork** – any high heat oil 
* **Chicken stock/broth**

### Preparation

1.	Season Pork with salt and pepper
2.	Open the peppers and pour the pepper juice into a bowl
3.	Place oil in frying pan that has a cover
4.	Heat oil to medium high
5.	Brown the pork strips for 5 minutes on two sides and 3 minutes on the other two sides
6.	For new cooks or cooks with limited experience you want to use a medium high heat but you do not want the pork to burn. This will take some attention to frying the first few times.
7.	A pan screen will be good to use too because using a medium high heat will cause splattering 
8.	When you turn the pork over there should be a brown crust on the pork side that just cooked
9.	When your pork is browned on all sides place in a platter.
10.	Dump the oil from the frying pan into a bowl to cool before discarding
11.	Place the pan back on the medium high heat and add pepper juice
12.	With a wooden spoon scrap the pan and bring up all those bits into the liquid and the sauce will start to turn a light brown. You will know when almost all the bits are off the pan when your wooden spoon glides easily through the pan hitting no resistance
13.	Place the pork back in the frying pan
14.	Also pour the pork juice from the platter into the frying pan and scrap to get every last drop
15.	Cover the pan and simmer for 20 minutes
16.	Check in 20 minutes and if the liquid in the pan is dissipating or at a lower level then when you started lower the heat and add a little chicken stock
17.	Check in 25 minutes and turn pork over and check the liquid level again
18.	While you are simmering the pork remove the stems and seeds from the peppers and place in a bowl
19.	Cook for another 25 minutes, check the liquid and adjust again if necessary and add peppers
20.	Cook for another 20 minutes
21.	It should be done at this time and plate

## Options & Extras

If you are making this for the first time take a piece of pork out of the pan, cut a piece, dip in the sauce and taste. The pork should be tender and sweet. If not simmer for another 10 minutes but it will most likely be done. 

This is a great meal to make a day or two ahead of time. Then when family of friends come to dinner place in a baking dish and heat at 350 &deg; F in the oven until hot. 

In the video I should have used 2 jars of peppers but was not thinking because this filming thing is new to us and even a little intimidating so we make some mistakes. But the recipe cooked in the video was gone in minutes.

Use hot peppers to if you like. If you are a beginner do not hesitate to make this recipe.

Have fun while cooking! Didyaeat?
