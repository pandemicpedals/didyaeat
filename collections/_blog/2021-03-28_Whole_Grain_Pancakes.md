## Recipe

### wet ingredients

1 - cup buttermilk
1 - large or ex-large egg
1 - tsp. vegetable oil, I love Sunflower or Safflower oil
1 - tsp. Vanilla, I probably use 2 tsp.

### dry ingredients

2/3 - cup whole wheat Pastry Flower
1/3 - cup Wheat Germ
1 - tsp. baking
1 - tsp. cinnamon
1/4 - tsp. nutmeg, I use 1/2 to 3/4 of a tsp.

After making the recipe for years I added the flax seeds and hemp hearts for the omega-3 fatty acids for heart health.

1 - tbsp. hemp hearts, I use 2 tbsp.
1 - tbsp. flax seeds, I use 2 tbsp.

The reason for listing amounts of ingredients but stating "I use" is because without "I use" is how we started the recipe but over time changed it to a taste, crunch and healthiness that we like. So start with the "as is" recipe and make change as you create your own taste!

## How to

With a whisk mix the dry ingredients into a 4 cup measuring bowl then mix the wet ingredients into an 8 cup measuring bowl then add the dry to the wet and mix to combine.

Set the temperature on a griddle to 350 degrees. Spray a griddle with canola oil. Then us a 1/3 measuring cup and scoop out the batter and add to the grill using a spoon to get all of the batter out of the 1/3 measuring cup. It will make six pancakes. If after 6 scoops there is batter left share among the 6 pancakes. Cook for 3 to 3 1/2 minutes on one side, flip and cook for another 3 to 3 1/2 minutes on the other side. Plate and eat! This is a half of a recipe so make a full recipe for 12 pancakes. You want leftover because they are great right out of the refrigerator cold as a snack with peanut butter or jam or freeze in a baggy after they cool down. When you want pancakes again take them out of the freeze and pop right in a toaster and you have pancakes again.
