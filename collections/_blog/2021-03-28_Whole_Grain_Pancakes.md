About 45 years ago we started trying to use less white flour and if we did used white flour it was
unbleached. We started making bread with whole wheat, rye and pumpernickel flour but we still made
pancakes with unbleached white flour. About 15 years ago we start using whole wheat pastry flour as a
substitute for white flour in baking cookies, scones, biscuits and pancakes. After making the basic recipe
below for 10 years adding blueberries or bananas to the mix I decided to try adding seeds. So one day I
added hemp hearts and whole flax seeds because of their nutritional value (Google nutrition) for
omega-3 fatty acids.

Always read the Ingredients and Preparation TWICE before you start!
{: .notice--info }

**PREPARATION**: 5 minutes<br>
**COOK TIME**: 6 minutes per batch<br>
**SERVINGS**: 6 pancakes

### Ingredients

**Wet Ingredients**
* **1 cup buttermilk**
* **1 large or ex-large egg**
* **1 tsp vegetable oil**, I love Sunflower or Safflower oil
* **1 tsp vanilla**, I probably use 2 tsp. 

**Dry Ingredients**
* **2/3 cup whole wheat Pastry Flour**
* **1/3 cup Wheat Germ**
* **1 tsp baking**
* **1 tsp cinnamon**
* **1/4 tsp nutmeg**, I use 1/2 to 3/4 of a tsp.

After making the recipe for years I added the flax seeds and hemp hearts for the omega-3 fatty acids for
heart health.

* **1 tbsp hemp hearts**, I use 2 tbsp.
* **1 tbsp flax seeds**, I use 2 tbsp.

The reason for listing amounts of ingredients but stating &quot;I use&quot; is because without &quot;I use&quot; is how we
started the recipe but over time changed it to a taste, crunch and healthiness that we like. So start with
the &quot;as is&quot; recipe and make changes as you create your own taste!

### Preparation:

1. With a whisk mix the dry ingredients into a 4 cup measuring bowl
2. Mix the wet ingredients into an 8 cup measuring bowl
3. Add the dry to the wet and mix to combine
4. Set the temperature on the griddle to 350 degrees
5. When at temperature, spray the griddle with canola oil
6. Using a 1/3 measuring cup, scoop out the batter and add to the grill using a spoon to get all
of the batter out of the cup. It will make six pancakes. If after 6 scoops there is
batter left share among the 6 pancakes
7. Cook for 3 to 3 1/2 minutes on one side, flip and cook for another 3 to 3 1/2 minutes on the
other side.

Plate and eat! This is a half of a recipe so make a full recipe for 12 pancakes. You want leftovers
because they are great right out of the refrigerator cold as a snack. You can add peanut butter,
Nutella Hazelnut Spread or jam and eat. Or freeze in a baggy separated by was paper after they cool
down. When you want pancakes again take them out of the freezer and pop right in the toaster and
you have pancakes again.
