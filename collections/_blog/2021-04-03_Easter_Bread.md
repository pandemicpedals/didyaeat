I learned to make this easter bread from my grandmother more than 50 years's ago. When I was collecting the recipes from here  it was always a pinch of this, and handful of that and a table spoon of the other. When converting those measurements to something I could write down and replicate I cound that a grandma Palma tablespoon was a half cup. This is why I remeasured everything as she baked.

My mother made these for year's for each of my boys. She shaped them into bunnies holding eggs. I  braid mine. I hope you enjoy the video. My grandson Mike helped me record it and kept me on track.

## Recipe

Grandma Anna Palma's Recipe

* 1 1/2	cups	sugar
* 1/2	cup	Crisco
* 1	large	potatoes mashed
* 1	cup	warm potatoes water
* 2	packets	yeast
* 3/4	cup	anisette
* 1/4	cup	anis seeds
* 1/2	teaspoon	salt
* 7	large	eggs
* 8	cups	flour (or whatever eggs take)

### Procedure:

1. Boil potatoes until soft.
2. Save water when draining.
3. Mash and set aside.
4. Put yeast in potatoes water that is about 100 to 110 degrees and set aside for about five minutes or till starts to bubble.
5. In a large bowl or mixer, mix together the sugar, Crisco and mashed potatoes till creamy.
6. Add anisette, anise seeds, salt eggs (one at a time) and water with yeast in it to mixture.
7. Add flour, one cup at a time. If using a mixer, after about 4 or 5 cups of flour you will have to turn dough out on a board with flour and start to kneed in remainder of the flour.
8. Knead dough till elastic or springs back when you pinch it.
9. Put dough into a oiled bowl, turning once till coated, (this prevents it from sticking to the bowl) cover and let rise till double.
10. Punch air out of dough and let rise for a second time till double.
11. It takes about one hour for each rising.
12. After second rising, punch out air and make loaves. Let rise one more time.
13. When double, brush tops with egg yolk with a little water added to it. Then bake.

**Bake in a 325 degree oven for about 45 minutes to an hour.**

### Forming a Braided Loaf

To braid bread, start with six long ropes. Number 1 - 6. 

1. First put 1 over to right the 6 over to left then bring 1 back to the middle. 
2. Next 2 over and 6 down to middle. 
3. Then 5 over and 2 down to middle. 
4. Continue till you have just a little dough left to tuck under.
