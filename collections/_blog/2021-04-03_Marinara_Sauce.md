There are a thousand ways to make Marinara Sauce. My Mom used Del Monte Tomato Sauce and Paste.
I had Aunts that made it with just paste. People use Tomato Sauce, Crushed Tomatoes, Diced Tomatoes
and some, not in our family actually used Ketchup with water! I had Aunt’s that added sugar. Some
people use as a seasoning fresh or dried Basil, Oregano, Parsley, Thyme and Rosemary. While others add
onion, garlic, celery, carrots or peppers. As you can see a thousand combinations are easily possible.

When it comes to tomato brands people swear by Pompadour San Marzano Tomatoes grown in
Campania under Mt Vesuvius, others are grown in Sicily. The only problem with that is, authentic
Pompadour tomatoes are only grown in certain areas of Italy. The others are grown all over the world
yet people pay a premium thinking they are getting the originals. High end restaurants charge customers
a fortune for Pompadour tomatoes and spinning a fork full of Spaghetti on a plate, drizzling sauce
around the plate with some shavings of Parmesan Cheese, topped with a sprinkle of fresh basil for only
$24.00. You can feed a small army Spaghetti for that price.

In the early 1970’s I used 28 ounce cans of Tuttorosso Whole Tomatoes with Basil crushing them with
my hand. Then I switch to crushed tomatoes of the same brand. When Shop Rite had them on sale I
would buy 4 – 12 can cases. In the 1990’s I was at Costco and saw 106 ounce can of S&amp;W Premium
Crushed Tomatoes and tried them and no one could tell the difference.

I want to give you a recipe that I have been using for 50 years with the ingredients I use today. The
concept is trying the recipe the way I give it to you a few times. Then keep it or experiment with
different tomatoes, vegetables, herbs and spices and develop your very own style. But the whole
process should be fun and always get the kids involved too.

{: .notice--info }

**PREPARATION**: 15 minutes<br>
**COOK TIME**: 30 minutes<br>
**SERVINGS**: Will accompany 3lbs of pasta<br>
**EPISODE**: xxx

### Ingredients

1 – Large red onion (the onions I use are about 14 to 16 ounces)<br>
1 – blub/bag of garlic (you can use 2 or 3 cloves but try the bulb or bag)<br>
1/4 – cup olive oil (you can use any oil, I use)<br>
1 – 106 ounce can of S&amp;W Crushed Tomatoes<br>
1 – tbsp. dried basil<br>
1 – tbsp. oregano<br>
1/3 to 1/2 – cup fresh parsley

### Preparation

1. Chop the red onion. Smash the garlic with the flat part of a chef’s knife and chop.
2. Place a 6 or 8 quart pan on medium high heat with the oil
3. After a few minutes drop a piece of onion in the oil, if it sizzles add onion and garlic. If it does
not sizzle wait a minute and drop another onion until it does.
4. Cook the onion and garlic on medium high heat because I want them to brown. Stirring every
couple of minutes. If they start to burn lower your heat. You will get comfortable with the
process.
5. After about 10 minutes they will be sizzling and brown, now add the crushed tomatoes. Keep
the heat on medium high and watch and stir until the sauce starts to bubble (not boil). Low the
heat to simmer. This should take about another 10 minutes.
6. Add your basil and oregano by placing them in the palm of your hand and rub your hands
together over the sauce to intensify their flavors, the fresh parsley and stir.
7. Simmer another 5 minutes and your Marinara Sauce is ready for Prime Time.

## Options & Extras

The smell of your kitchen and house will make your family and guest feel like they are in the best Italian
restaurant. Let the kids help by opening the can of sauce, plucking the parsley leaves from the stems or
by measuring out the basil and oregano in a dish and by stirring the sauce.

I also on occasion when the onions and garlic are brown I add a 1/2 cup of red wine (Pinot Noir) to
degrease the pan and cook until the wine is almost gone then add the sauce.

Always cook more than you need because it freezes well. Pour leftover sauce in quart or gallon freezer
bags, lay flay on a cookie sheet and freeze. Then you can stack on top of one another or stand up in the
freezer nest to each other.

The whole point of cooking is to have fun! Involve your children, family and friends. That is how you
learn and develop you own style and taste.
