Many people state I don't like Beets they taste like dirt or have never eaten Beets or any other root vegetable. Beets are very healthy (google nutrition) for you and taste good too. My Mom always made Beet salad, which I will do a video on later. But we love roasted beets. After eating roasted beets for years one day I tried pouring some 23 year old Denissimo Balsamic Vinegar on them which created a sweeter flavor. So even if you have never tried roasted beets give them a chance you might be surprised.
