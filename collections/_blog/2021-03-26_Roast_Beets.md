Many people state I don't like beets they taste like dirt or have never eaten beets or any other root
vegetable. Beets are very healthy (Google nutrition) for you and taste good too. My Mom always made
beet salad, which I will do a video of later. But we love roasted beets. After eating roasted beets for
years with basil and oregano added one day I tried pouring some 23 year old Denissimo Balsamic
Vinegar on them which created an even sweeter taste. So even if you have never tried beets give them a
chance you might be surprised of the delicious taste and flavor.

## Recipe

Always read the Ingredients and Preparations TWICE before you start!
{: .notice--info }

**PREPARATIONS**: 10 minutes<br>
**COOK TIME**: 30 minutes<br>
**SERVINGS**: 4

### Ingredients

* **1 bunch of beets**
* **2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil**
* **Salt to taste pepper to taste**
* **1/4 cup balsamic vinegar** (we use Denissimo 23 year old Balsamic Vinegar but the store brand is a good start)

You can add either or both of the following, when you add the salt and pepper:

* **1 tbsp dried basil**
* **1 tbsp dried oregano**

### Preparation

1. Cut the top of the beets off where the stems are located
2. Wash in cold water and scrub with a food brush, then dry.
3. Cut beets into 3/4 to 1 inch pieces and if some are bigger than others do not worry
4. Place in a bowl, add extra virgin olive oil, salt and pepper and if you wish dried basil or oregano
or both
5. Mix till the beets are covered with the oil and seasoning
6. Place in a roasting pan covered with aluminum foil (for ease of cleaning) that has a thin cover of
oil to the pan either with a spray can or oil spread thinly with a paper towel. Remember the
beets are covered with oil so the pan only needs a thin film
7. Bake at 375&deg; F for 30 minutes
8. After 30 minutes check tenderness with a fork. We like them a little crunchie. But cook to your
own desired tenderness.

## Extras

I have made this recipe many times for friends that do not like or have never eaten beets and vast
majorities now eat beets. Please remember that the next day when you awake and have your morning
constitutional you will see red but do not panic it is from the beets and it can last a few days. Lastly
there might be many items that you did not eat or hated when you were young but try them again now.
Your taste changes as you age and cooking methods can improve or enhance the taste.
